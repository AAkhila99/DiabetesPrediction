## Diabetes Prediction

This project aims to predict the onset of diabetes in individuals based on various health metrics using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression algorithms.

## Introduction

Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection and management are crucial for preventing complications and improving the quality of life for those affected. Machine learning techniques offer promising avenues for predicting diabetes risk based on various health parameters.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to develop predictive models that can accurately classify individuals as either diabetic or non-diabetic based on features such as glucose levels, blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), etc.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains anonymized health information of individuals, including demographic features and health metrics. It is sourced from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database. The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize features, and ensure data quality.

## Algorithms Used

1. Support Vector Machine (SVM)

2. Logistic Regression

As this is a classification problem with its dataset on the smaller side, SVM and Logistic Regression algorithms have been chosen.

## Implementation

The project implementation is divided into the following steps:

1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and feature normalization.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Understanding the distribution of features, identifying correlations, and gaining insights into the dataset.
3. Model Training: Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, training SVM and Logistic Regression models on the training data.
4. Model Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the trained models using relevant metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
(Focus is more on recall score/ Sensitivity as it is the most important evaluation metric in medical diagnosis of high-risk dieseases. This is, it is crucial to minimize false negatives - cases where the disease is present but not detected. High sensitivity ensures that the model captures as many true positive cases as possible, thus reducing the chances of missing diagnoses and enabling early intervention.)
6. Model Comparison: Comparing the performance of SVM and Logistic Regression models to determine the most effective algorithm for diabetes prediction.

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies such as scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to preprocess the data, train the models, and evaluate their performance.

## Conclusion

By leveraging machine learning techniques such as SVM and Logistic Regression, this project aims to contribute to early diabetes detection and prevention. The predictive models developed can assist healthcare professionals in identifying individuals at risk, enabling timely intervention and management strategies.
